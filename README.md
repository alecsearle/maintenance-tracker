# Maintenance Tracker (yet to be named)

Maintenance Tracker is created to fill the gap between the manual labor and mechanical maintenance world. Tracking the maintenance of your equipment can be a timely and forgotten task, leading to equipment being down when it is needed or equipment not ready to be used at the start of a job, all of which cost the company money. Maintenance Tracker provides an easy way to log tool usage and view upcoming/preventative maintenance to be sure your equipment is not out of service when you need it most.
